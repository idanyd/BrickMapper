# BrickMapper

A computer vision project to automatically identify and track LEGO pieces throughout instruction manuals. BrickMapper uses machine learning to analyze LEGO instruction manual PDFs, detect individual pieces and map their usage across building steps.

## Project Overview

BrickMapper processes official LEGO instruction manuals to:

- Extract and analyze building steps from PDF files
- Identify individual LEGO pieces using computer vision
- Track piece usage throughout the building process
- Store and manage piece/step relationships in a database

## Key Features

- PDF processing pipeline for LEGO instruction manuals
- Computer vision model for LEGO piece identification
- SQLite database for piece and instruction step tracking
- Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow for computer vision
- SQLite for data storage
- pandas/scikit-learn for data processing
- Jupyter for analysis and presentation

## Project Status

🚧 Under Development

✅ Data infrastructure
🔄 PDF processing pipeline
📋 Computer vision model (planned)
📋 Integration and scaling (planned)
